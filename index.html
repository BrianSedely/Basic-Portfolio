                Hi. I'm Brian Sedely. I live in Winter Garden, Florida with my wife Lydia, 
                my two sons Christian and Caleb, Manny the dog and Ellie the cat.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've worked in Banking and Financial Services for nearly 13 years. 
                I spent most of my time in various divisions of SunTrust, but as of 2014,
                I work for Seaside National Bank & Trust, a community bank headquartered in Orlando.
                The University of Central Florida is my alma mater (class of '07), as well as where I completed B-school (MBA class of '13). 
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy any kind of sport you can do behind a boat, especially wakeboarding. 
                (I don't get to go frequent enough).
                I like music, both listening and playing music on guitar, bass, or drums.
            </p>
